convener
========

Convener is a event / conference schedule application.  It will include:

* Session times
* Tracks
* Speaker information
* Session locations
* A desktop and mobile friendly view
* Ability to save preferred sessions
* and other features as I/we think of them...

The system is being built on Django 1.5 and Django Rest Framework for the backend and AngularJS for the front-end.

Additional documentation will come as I get further into development.  If you would like to help out, submit a pull request or reach out to me on twitter [@ken_ingle](http://www.twitter.com/ken_ingle)
